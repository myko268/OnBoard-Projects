# Business Card

Currently, I've made my board to become a utility that can be used in an actual business. I will show this card to anyone who looks for a service that my business offers.

This card will cost me $2.

A little bit of a challenge I've had while designing this card was understanding the different type of designs I can add onto my card. Though, I had plenty of resources in front of me so I had almost no struggle pieceing together how to make a PCB Hacker Card.
